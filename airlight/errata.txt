AirRelay v1
 * I bought the fixed version of the regulator, and the board is configured for
   the adjustable one. Simply don't populate the 240 or 390 Ohm resistors 
   (R16 and R17), and glom the negative side of C1 (right pad) to the left pad 
   of R17 so that regulator pin is tied to ground.
 * 5V and VCC are supposed to the the same net, but they are not connected on 
   the board. To fix, Run a line from the upper pin of the 3.3V regulator to 
   the left leg of the Link LED.
 * MOSI and 5V_MOSI are supposed to be the same net. Wire from the BSS138 to 
   the MOSI on the ISP programming header.
